CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findwrap_zmq.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "wrap_zmq",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "wrap_zmq" with any
  of the following names:

    wrap_zmqConfig.cmake
    wrap_zmq-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "wrap_zmq" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "wrap_zmq_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "wrap_zmq" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
